# Capstone-3-Daegu-Apartment-Price-Prediction-Analysis
This repository hosts the code and findings of a project to predict apartment prices in Daegu, South Korea, using various regression models. The tuned Decision Tree Regressor emerged as the top performer. Insights, model optimization and application strategies are also shared.

# Repository Content
1. Data_Cleaning.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the process of data cleaning.
2. Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb: Notebook including the model training, tuning and evaluation.
3. Models/: Folder containing the trained models.
4. Data/: Folder with the dataset used in this project.

# Key Findings
1. The tuned Decision Tree Regressor achieved the best performance with a MAPE of 19.07%.
2. Apartment type, size, and the number of basement parking spaces were identified as the most influential features affecting apartment prices.

# Future Recommendation
1. Optimize the Decision Tree Regressor by incorporating additional influential features.
2. Tune the model parameters for improved accuracy.
3. Consider evaluating other models like Neural Networks or LightGBM for potentially better results.
4. Utilize the model as a tool for real estate agents to determine apartment pricing and enhance sales performance.
5. Conduct deeper analysis on the influential features for more insights into their impact on apartment prices.
6. Use the insights gained from this model for developing predictive models for other locations.

Feel free to explore the code and use the insights for further development of predictive models for real estate pricing. Contributions and suggestions for improvements are always welcome!
